# Practical LLM Applications

This repository is a collection of projects demonstrating practical applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). The key focus is on runimg open-source models locally, enabling development without relying on proprietary APIs.

Each project is contained within its own folder and includes a dedicated README with detailed setup and conceptual explanations.

## 🛠️ Core Technologies

This repository primarily uses the following technologies:

- **[LangChain]:** The core framework for orchestrating LLM workflows.
- **[Ollama]:** For running and managing local LLMs and embedding models.
- **[LangGraph]:** For building stateful, multi-actor applications.
- **[Pydantic]:** For defining data schemas to enable reliable, structured output.

## 🔧 General Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
   
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-llm-repo.git
    cd your-llm-repo
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
   
    Install dependencies based on the project you want to run.
